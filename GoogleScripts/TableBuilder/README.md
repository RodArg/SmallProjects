Hello, welcome to my Google Script: TableBuilder!

Turns out that creating multiple tables on Google Docs is a huge pain, having to click on insert, scroll down to table, then drag your mouse to build your table, and doing so repeatedly drives me nuts.

To fix this, I created a "simple" script that builds a table for you, all you have to do is type the number of rows in the "rows" prompt and the number of columns in the "columns" prompt and click the "Build Table" button. Et voila, you now have an R x C table. You can spam this, change the numbers, whatever, and quickly get your tables going.

I will be publishing this add-on through Google's add-ons store, so you can download it from there. However, if that's too annoying for you, you can also open up a Google Doc, go to 

1. Tools -> Script Editor
2. Copy paste my .gs text into your Code.gs 
3. File -> New HYML File and copy paste my .html text into your own. 
4. Run the script from your Google Doc -> Add-ons -> <Your Script Name>
5. Enjoy your easy peasy tables
